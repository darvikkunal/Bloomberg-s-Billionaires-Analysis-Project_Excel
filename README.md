## Project Overview
This project involves extracting data from the Bloomberg website, cleaning and transforming it using Excel's Power Pivot, validating the data with Excel's data tools, and conducting detailed analysis with pivot tables. Finally, a comprehensive dashboard was created using slicers, pivot charts, and pivot tables. VLOOKUP was also utilized in the process.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation
Data cleaning and transformation were performed using Excel's Power Pivot. This included:
- Removing duplicates
- Handling missing values
- Normalizing data formats
- Aggregating and summarizing relevant statistics

## Data Validation
Data validation was carried out using Excel's data tools to ensure accuracy and consistency. VLOOKUP functions were employed to cross-reference and validate data entries.

## Detailed Analysis
Pivot tables were used to provide a detailed explanation and analysis of the data. These tables allowed for the exploration of various dimensions and metrics to gain insights.

## Dashboard Creation
A dynamic dashboard was created using Excel's slicers, pivot charts, and pivot tables. This dashboard enables interactive data exploration and visualization.
